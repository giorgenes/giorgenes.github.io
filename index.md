## Software Developer

            Hi, I'm a ruby software developer bases in Melbourne, Australia.
            I've been working with open source tools for more than 20 years.
            For many years I worked with more low level technologies like C on
            Linux for server side processing, and on the most
            recent years I've been working with web development
            which is my current focus and passion.
